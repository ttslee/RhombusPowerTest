As of 6:34PM 2/9/22 I have completed all parts of the challenge. I would like to have an improved 3d visualization. I certainly could have done a few things differently to make it look cleaner and have less down time. I have created a 2d visualization with a scroller to see the sightings at any given year. I like my 2d visualization a lot and could do other things with it like providing statistics on the current year.

I added music to provide some ambiance. Doesn't really fit the best but its a chill tune. 

With more time, I would have liked to improve 3 things.

1. improved 3D visualization and game concept to provide more feedback and less down time to the player

2. improved animations and models/adding more particle effects/shaders

3. Add more functionality to my 2D visualization. I feel like the 2D visualization is the most interesting development that I made and would like to explore it further.

Thanks for reading!
